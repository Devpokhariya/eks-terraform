# Ignore any .tfvars files that are generated automatically for each Terraform run. Most
# .tfvars files are managed as part of configuration and so should be included in
# version control.

# Ignore override files as they are usually used to override resources locally and so
# are not checked in

# Project files, i.e. `.project`, `.actionScriptProperties` and `.flexProperties`
# should NOT be excluded as they contain compiler settings and other important
# information for Eclipse / Flash Builder.
